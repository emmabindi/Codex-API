## Target Audience

The target audience for Codex is software developers in particular developers who are beginning their learning journey or going through a transition which requires tracking learning goals. 

As the technology industry changes so rapidly, developers need to continuously learn in order to keep their skills up to date. 

The target audience are tech savvy useers who own and use desktop/laptop computers daily. It is expected that the users of Codex will access using Desktop browser window 60% of the time and 40% of the time via their mobile devices.

## User Stories & Personas 

#### Persona #1: Liam 

Liam is a junior frontend developer who has been working for a tech company for nearly two years. He wants to level up his skills, either get a promotion or new role, and learn machine learning. To do this he requires a new skill set, such as learning CS concepts and learning Python.

In order for Liam to keep track of his notes and progress on his self studying journey, he requires a system to organise his notes and keep track of his studying progress. Since he is currently busy with his junior dev role, Liam aims to fit in a few hours of self study each day after work and on weekends.

Codex will be able to provide Liam the right tools for managing notes, journal entries, tracking study time and goals achieved as well as providing analytics. The app also allows him to bookmark useful links to relevant articles related to relevant topics. When commuting to work (not in lockdown), the app is accessible on mobile, allowing use on public transport.

**Liam's User Stories:** 

- As a user, I want to add daily journal entries, that log specific topics of things I learnt and keeping track of accomplishments and areas that need improvement
- As a user, I’d like to set goals, be able to check them off and see my progress on what has been achieved.
- As a user, I wish to organise my journal entries and bookmarks by categories, using folders and tags 
- As a user, I’d like to search for these entries and bookmarks that can be filtered through a search bar
- As a user, I want to keep track of my study time using a pomodoro timer, which will keep logs of the amount of total time studied per day
- As a user, I want to view detailed analytic reports of all app usage including how many journal entries, numbers of bookmarks saved, total time studied using the pomodoro clock and how often I achieve my set goals.
- As a user when creating journal entries, I want to be able to provide a title of the post and edit the body using a rich text editor that allows for code snippets, titles, and block quotes
- As a user a I wish to add or remove categories from my entries and bookmarks to reorganise entries when needed
- As a user, I require everything to be displayed in an accessible, intuitive and responsive dashboard.
- As a user, I want the ability to delete my account if necessary.

#### Persona #2: Blake

Blake is currently undertaking a full stack web development bootcamp and prior to this had no experience with coding. 

As a newbie to coding, Blake is having a hard time keeping track of all the new concepts and useful tools that she is learning at the bootcamp. Currently she has 13 bookmarks folders in her Chrome browser which she can’t search through easily, as well as notes in Google Docs, handy code snippets spread out everywhere- in the lesson materials, some within project source code and others just copy & pasted into the Notes app of her MacBook. 

Blake is wanting to centralise all her learning materials in one place and be able to search through them easily.  
Also, when Blake is preparing for job interviews she is finding it difficult to recall all of the new concepts she has learned and succinctly capture the wins and challenges from her coding journey so far. Blake would love clear data to show her learning progress and a summary of achievements to date.

Blake also has a few notepads on the desk where she is tracking the daily tasks to achieve and would love a one stop shop to capture a daily coding journal, any useful bookmarks or re-usable code snippets as well as have a task list all on the one screen. 

**Blake’s User Stories**

- As a user I want to track my daily code experiences which are captured with a date stamp, to gain an overview of my learning journey   
- As a user I want to tag my journal entries with themes such as #react #context   
- As a user I want to be able to record code blocks for future reference with syntax highlighting   
- As a user I want to store useful bookmarks into categories to organise my links   
- As a user I want to be able to search my journal entries by keywords   
- As a user I want to be able to filter my journal entries by date added
- As a user I want to be able to sort my bookmarks by category or tags  
- As a user I want to have a centralised dashboard for storing my bookmarks, journal entries and track my to-do tasks rather than 3 separate apps   
- As a user I want to track how much time I spend coding each day to achieve my #100daysofcode goals  
- As a user I want to produce reports showing data of how much time I have spent coding, how many journal entries I have recorded so I can be encouraged by the progress of my learning and see tangible evidence of my goal achievements    
- As a user I want to be able to access the app on mobile as well as desktop, as I am often reading Medium articles and Twitter on my train commute   
- As a user I want to be able to delete my account along with my personal data if I so wish  

--- 

#### Persona #3: Guest  

Guest: new visitor to Codex who is interested in finding out the functionality and features on offer. 

- As a guest, I want to be able to view the functionality and features of the site before signing up 

- As a guest I want to be able to sign up securely in order to be able to record my journal entries and data 

&nbsp;

#### User Stories Summary

Some user stories were removed from the final product as we determined a focus on MVP and the user stories outside of this MVP were omitted. This was to ensure we remained focus on achieving the MVP goals within the given timeframes.

For example, user stories removed: 
- As a user I want to see my Github activity and track that against my goals
- As a user I want to view my CodeWars kata status and list of completed challenges 
- As a user I want to receive notifications from Codex to alert me that it is my scheduled time to begin coding 
- As a user I want to be able to reset my password or change my email address 

Additional user stories were identified throughout the planning process and subsequently added, such as 'as a user I want to filter my journal entries by date'.

### Manual Testing Summary 

The exercise of manual testing throughout development and production environments was very useful for our app development. 

The process of testing resulted in identification of bugs as well as any 'less than ideal' user experiences and as a result we added new tickets to our Trello To-Do lists to resolve these. 

*Example of testing comments providing useful feedback which resulted in additional Trello tickets*:

## Project Management

Methodology: 

We kicked off the project idea brainstorming together and worked the first few days of the development lifecycle together, sharing ideas and making decisions as a team. 

Once we had settled on a direction, determined MVP and had a rough outline of the timeframe in which we wanted to achieve we then discussed the strengths of each person and determined that although completing the project together as a team, we would put Michael in the drivers seat for the front end development aspect and Emma in the drivers seat for the back end development. 

Every single day of the development sprint we worked online together in a Discord server, constantly asking each other questions, sharing progress and helping each other out. Every day, the task goals for that day were assessed first thing in the morning with those tasks allocated to Emma or Michael and moved to Doing in the Trello board. The Trello board was revisited every day at lunch again to check in with progress. 

Despite each taking a drivers seat for API/client, both team members contributed to the code base of the other repository respectively. And all challenging or watershed aspects of the app development were tackled by pair programming. 

Below is an overview of the tasks completed each day which has been summarised from our shared daily journal and legend displays the delegation of tasks.
